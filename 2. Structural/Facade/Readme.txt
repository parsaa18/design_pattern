What is Facade Design Pattern:

The Facade Design Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use. It acts like a "front door" that hides the complexity of multiple classes or components behind a single, easy-to-use interface. This pattern is useful when you want to reduce the learning curve for interacting with a complicated system or make your code more readable.

Pros:
  -Simplifies interaction with complex subsystems.
  -Reduces coupling between clients and subsystem components.
  -Improves code readability and maintainability.

Cons:
  -An extra layer of code (the Facade).
  -Can become a "god object" if the Facade handles too many responsibilities.
  -May hide useful subsystem features if the Facade is too restrictive.
