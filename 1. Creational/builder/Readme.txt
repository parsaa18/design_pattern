What is Builder Design Pattern:

The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern that simplifies the creation of complex objects by breaking the construction process into smaller, manageable steps. Instead of passing many parameters to a constructor or function, you use a Builder object to set properties step-by-step and then build the final object. This makes the code more readable, flexible, and easier to maintain, especially for objects with many optional fields.

Basically when you have a complex object with so many parameters and you don't want to pass all of them at once you use this Design Pattern

Pros:

  -Simplifies creating a complex object
  -Handling optional features better
  -Cleaner and more maintainable and more readable code style
  -Also you can set a validation in the builder for each feature
